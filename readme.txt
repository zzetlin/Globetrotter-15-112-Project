Name of the TP: Globetrotter. 
Globetrotter displays a map of 15,000 cities throughout the world. 
Users can make an account and plan trips by typing in the cities they want to visit. 
Using the simplex algorithm, the shortest path between these cities will be calculated 
and the suggested route between the cities will be displayed. Users can zoom in, and 
recommendations of a city to add to certain trip will be generated. 


To run the project, have the TPFinal.py, userdata.csv, worldcities.csv, and cmu_112_graphics.py in the same folder and open TPFInal.py. Just begin by inserting a username and password! 

I am not using any libraries. 

There are no shortcut commands.
